<p align="justify">
This system is a web-based system about library management system to manage all the works. There are managed reservations, payment confirmations, registrations, etc.
There are three benefits from this system. They are user, librarian, and management. In this system, users are informed about what books are available, how they can reserve, what are the facilities, offers, and packages they have. The site administrator can manage the packages, user reservations, payments, and all the library-related thing using this site.
